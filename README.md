# Universal ESP32 Workbench

A Raspberry Pi that turns into a complete remote test instrument for ESP32 devices. Plug your boards into its USB hub, and control everything — serial, WiFi, BLE, GPIO, firmware updates — over the network through a single HTTP API.

---

## Services

### 1. Remote Serial (RFC2217)

Each USB port on the Pi's hub gets a **fixed TCP port**. Plug an ESP32 into port 1 and it's always reachable at `rfc2217://pi:4001`, regardless of what `/dev/ttyUSB*` name Linux assigns. Swap boards freely — the port follows the physical connector, not the device.

Works with esptool, PlatformIO, ESP-IDF, and any pyserial-based tool. One client at a time per device.

**What happens on plug/unplug:** udev detects the event, notifies the portal, and the RFC2217 proxy starts or stops automatically. No manual intervention needed.

**ESP32 reset behavior:** The Pi can reset devices via DTR/RTS signals over the serial connection. This works differently depending on the chip:

| Chip | USB Interface | Device Node | Reset Method | Caveat |
|------|--------------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| ESP32, ESP32-S2 | External UART bridge (CP2102, CH340) | `/dev/ttyUSB*` | DTR/RTS toggle | Reliable, no issues |
| ESP32-C3, ESP32-S3 | Native USB-Serial/JTAG | `/dev/ttyACM*` | DTR/RTS toggle | Linux asserts DTR+RTS on port open, which puts the chip into **download mode** during early boot. The Pi adds a 2-second delay before opening the port to avoid this. |

**Download mode vs normal boot:** ESP32 chips use GPIO0 (active LOW) to select boot mode. If GPIO0 is held LOW during reset, the chip enters download mode (for flashing). In normal operation GPIO0 has an internal pull-up, so the chip boots normally. The UART bridge chips (CP2102) use a capacitor-based circuit to pulse GPIO0 only during the esptool handshake — this is transparent to the user.

### 2. WiFi Test Instrument

The Pi's **wlan0** radio acts as a programmable WiFi access point or station, isolated from the wired LAN on eth0.

- **AP mode** — start a SoftAP with any SSID/password. DUTs connect to `192.168.4.x`, Pi is at `192.168.4.1`. DHCP and DNS included.
- **STA mode** — join a DUT's captive portal AP as a station to test provisioning flows.
- **HTTP relay** — proxy HTTP requests through the Pi's radio to devices on its WiFi network.
- **Scan** — list nearby WiFi networks to verify a DUT's AP is broadcasting.

AP and STA are mutually exclusive — starting one stops the other.

### 3. GPIO Control

Drive Pi GPIO pins from test scripts to simulate button presses on the DUT. The most common use: **hold a pin LOW during reset** to force the DUT into a specific boot mode (captive portal, factory reset, etc.).

**Allowed pins (BCM numbering):** 5, 6, 12, 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27

**Important:** Always release pins when done by setting them to `"z"` (high-impedance input). A pin left driven LOW will prevent the DUT from booting normally.

**Standard wiring:**

| Pi GPIO (BCM) | Pin # | DUT Pin | Function |
|---------------|-------|---------|----------|
| 17 | 11 | EN/RST | Hardware reset (active LOW) |
| 18 | 12 | GPIO0 (ESP32) / GPIO9 (ESP32-C3) | Boot mode select (active LOW → download mode) |
| 27 | 13 | — | Spare 1 |
| 22 | 15 | — | Spare 2 |

**GPIO0 vs GPIO9:** Classic ESP32 uses GPIO0 for boot mode selection. ESP32-C3/S3 with native USB use GPIO9 instead. Both are active LOW — hold LOW during reset to enter download/portal mode.

Example — trigger captive portal mode without touching the board:
```
1. GPIO 18 → LOW          (hold DUT boot-select pin low)
2. GPIO 17 → LOW, wait, → "z"   (pulse EN/RST to reset DUT)
3. DUT boots with boot pin held low → enters captive portal
4. GPIO 18 → "z"          (release immediately)
```

### 4. UDP Log Receiver

Listens on **UDP port 5555** for debug log output from ESP32 devices. This is essential when the USB port is occupied (e.g., ESP32-S3 running as USB HID keyboard) and you can't use a serial monitor.

The ESP32 firmware sends `ESP_LOG` output to the Pi's IP over UDP. Logs are buffered (last 2000 lines) and available via the HTTP API, filterable by source IP and timestamp.

**ESP32 side** — point your UDP logging to `esp32-workbench.local:5555` (or whatever the Pi's IP is).

### 5. OTA Firmware Repository

Serves firmware binaries over HTTP so ESP32 devices can perform OTA updates from the local network. No internet or GitHub access required during development.

Upload a `.bin` file to the Pi, then point the ESP32's OTA URL to:
```
http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/firmware/<project-name>/<filename>.bin
```

Firmware is stored in `/var/lib/rfc2217/firmware/` organized by project subdirectory.

### 6. BLE Proxy

Uses the Pi's **onboard Bluetooth radio** to scan for, connect to, and send raw bytes to BLE peripherals. The Pi acts as a dumb BLE-to-HTTP bridge — you send hex-encoded bytes via the API, and the Pi writes them to the specified GATT characteristic.

This enables remote control of BLE devices from test scripts or AI agents. For example, sending keystrokes to an ESP32 running as a BLE-USB keyboard, or triggering OTA updates via BLE command.

**Limitation:** One BLE connection at a time (single radio).

**Prerequisite:** Bluetooth must be powered on:
```bash
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
sudo bluetoothctl power on
```

### 7. CW Beacon (Morse Transmitter)

Generates a **Morse-keyed RF carrier** on GPIO 5 (pin 29) or GPIO 6 (pin 31) using the BCM2835 hardware clock generator (GPCLK). Designed for **direction finder testing** on the 80m amateur band (3.5–4.0 MHz). No additional hardware needed — just a wire antenna on the GPIO pin.

- Frequency source: PLLD (500 MHz) with integer divider — jitter-free output
- Resolution: ~25–30 kHz steps in the 80m band (e.g. 3.571, 3.597, 3.846 MHz)
- Morse timing: PARIS standard, configurable 1–60 WPM
- Keying: GPIO function-select toggle (ALT0 ↔ INPUT) — no phase glitches

```bash
# Start beacon at ~3.571 MHz, 12 WPM
curl -X POST http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/api/cw/start \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"freq": 3571000, "message": "VVV DE TEST", "wpm": 12}'

# List available frequencies
curl http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/api/cw/frequencies?low=3500000&high=4000000

# Stop
curl -X POST http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/api/cw/stop
```

### 8. Remote GDB Debugging

Connect GDB to ESP32 devices over the network. OpenOCD runs on the Pi with direct USB access; GDB connects from containers via TCP. No USB drivers or JTAG hardware needed on the developer's machine.

**Three approaches:**

| Approach | Chips | Extra Hardware | Serial During Debug |
|----------|-------|:-:|:-:|
| USB JTAG | C3, C6, H2, S3 (native USB) | None | Yes |
| Dual-USB | S3 (two USB ports) | None | Yes + app USB |
| ESP-Prog | All variants | ESP-Prog + cable | Yes |

**Verified chips (USB JTAG):**

| Chip | JTAG TAP ID | OpenOCD Config |
|------|------------|----------------|
| ESP32-C3 | `0x00005c25` | `board/esp32c3-builtin.cfg` |
| ESP32-C6 | `0x0000dc25` | `board/esp32c6-builtin.cfg` |
| ESP32-H2 | `0x00010c25` | `board/esp32h2-builtin.cfg` |
| ESP32-S3 | `0x120034e5` | `board/esp32s3-builtin.cfg` |

OpenOCD starts **automatically** when a device is plugged in — no API call needed. The workbench auto-detects the chip type and exposes the GDB port in `/api/devices`. Serial and JTAG coexist on the same USB connection.

```bash
# Check what's connected — GDB port is ready automatically
curl http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/api/devices | jq '.slots[] | select(.debugging) | {label, debug_chip, debug_gdb_port}'

# Connect GDB from container (example: C3)
riscv32-esp-elf-gdb build/project.elf \
  -ex "target extended-remote esp32-workbench.local:3335" \
  -ex "monitor reset halt"
```

For classic ESP32 boards without USB JTAG, the workbench automatically falls back to an ESP-Prog probe if one is configured.

### 9. Test Automation

Two additional services support automated test workflows:

- **Test progress tracking** — push live test session updates (start, step, result, end) to the web portal. Operators see a real-time progress panel without needing a terminal.
- **Human interaction requests** — block a test script until an operator confirms a physical action (cable swap, power cycle, antenna repositioning). The web portal shows a modal with the instruction and Done/Cancel buttons.

### 10. Web Portal

A browser-based dashboard at **http://pi-ip:8080** showing:
- Serial slot status (running/empty/flapping/recovering/download mode)
- WiFi AP/STA state and connected stations
- Activity log with color-coded entries
- Test progress panel
- Human interaction modal

## Hardware Setup

### What You Need

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Raspberry Pi** (Zero W, 3, 4, or 5) | Runs the portal. Needs onboard WiFi + Bluetooth. |
| **USB Ethernet adapter** | Wired LAN on eth0 (wlan0 is reserved for WiFi testing) |
| **USB hub** | Connect multiple ESP32 boards (if needed) |
| **Jumper wires** (optional) | Pi GPIO → DUT GPIO for automated boot mode control |

### Network Topology

```
 LAN (192.168.0.x)
       |
       | eth0 (wired)
       v
  Raspberry Pi ---- wlan0 (WiFi test AP: 192.168.4.x)

       |
  +----+----+----+
  |    |    |    |
 :4001 :4002 :4003

```

eth0 carries all management traffic (HTTP API, RFC2217 serial). wlan0 is dedicated to WiFi testing. They never overlap.

### Network Ports

| Port | Protocol | Direction | Purpose |
|------|----------|-----------|---------|
| 8080 | TCP/HTTP | Clients → Pi | Web portal, REST API, firmware downloads |
| 4001+ | TCP/RFC2217 | Clients → Pi | Serial connections (one per USB slot) |
| 5555 | UDP | ESP32 → Pi | Debug log receiver |
| 5888 | UDP | Clients ↔ Pi | Discovery beacon |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SensorsIot/Universal-ESP32-Workbench.git
cd Universal-ESP32-Workbench/pi
bash install.sh
```

This installs all dependencies (pyserial, hostapd, dnsmasq, bleak, esptool), copies scripts to `/usr/local/bin/`, creates the firmware directory, and starts the portal as a systemd service.

### Slot Configuration

Discover which USB connector maps to which slot key:

```bash
rfc2217-learn-slots     # Plug in one device at a time
```

Edit the configuration:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/rfc2217/slots.json
```

```json
{
  "slots": [
    {"slot_key": "platform-3f980000.usb-usb-0:1.2:1.0", "label": "ESP32-A", "tcp_port": 4001},
    {"slot_key": "platform-3f980000.usb-usb-0:1.3:1.0", "label": "ESP32-B", "tcp_port": 4002}
  ]
}
```

Restart after editing: `sudo systemctl restart rfc2217-portal`

    ut.gpio_set(17, 0)                   # Pull EN/RST LOW (reset)
    time.sleep(0.1)
    ut.gpio_set(17, "z")                 # Release reset — DUT boots into portal
finally:
    ut.gpio_set(18, "z")                 # Always release boot pin

ut.test_step("TC-001", "WiFi Connect", "Joining AP...")
ut.test_result("TC-001", "WiFi Connect", "PASS")
ut.test_end()
```

### OTA Firmware Update Workflow

The workbench provides a complete end-to-end OTA workflow for ESP32 devices connected via its WiFi AP:

```bash
# 1. Upload firmware to the workbench's OTA repository
curl -X POST http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/api/firmware/upload \
  -F "project=ios-keyboard" -F "file=@build/ios-keyboard.bin"

# 2. Verify the firmware is downloadable
#    (ESP32 will fetch from this URL during OTA)
curl -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" \
  http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/firmware/ios-keyboard/ios-keyboard.bin

# 3. Trigger OTA on the ESP32 via HTTP relay
#    (the ESP32 must expose a /ota endpoint and be connected to the workbench's AP)
curl -X POST http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/api/wifi/http \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"method":"POST","url":"http://192.168.4.15/ota"}'

# 4. Monitor progress via UDP logs
curl http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/api/udplog?source=192.168.4.15
```

The ESP32 device must:
- Be connected to the workbench's WiFi AP (e.g. via `POST /api/enter-portal`)
- Have an HTTP server with a `POST /ota` endpoint that triggers `esp_ota_ops`
- Configure its OTA URL to `http://esp32-workbench.local:8080/firmware/<project>/<file>.bin`

The workbench's HTTP relay (`POST /api/wifi/http`) bridges the gap between the LAN network and the WiFi AP network, allowing remote triggering of OTA from any client on the LAN.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Connection refused on serial port | Proxy not running | Check portal at :8080; verify device is plugged in |
| Timeout during flash | Network latency over RFC2217 | Use `esptool --no-stub` for reliability |
| Port busy | Another client connected | Close the other connection first (RFC2217 = 1 client) |
| USB flapping (rapid connect/disconnect) | Erased/corrupt flash, boot loop | Portal auto-recovers: unbinds USB, enters download mode via GPIO. Check slot state in `/api/devices`. Manual trigger: `POST /api/serial/recover` |
| Slot stuck in `recovering` | Recovery thread running | Wait for `download_mode` (GPIO) or `idle` (no-GPIO). Takes 10-80s depending on retry count |
| Slot in `download_mode` | Device waiting in bootloader | Flash firmware on Pi, then `POST /api/serial/release` to reboot |
| ESP32-C3 stuck in download mode | DTR asserted on port open | Use `--after=watchdog-reset` with esptool, never `hard-reset` |
| DUT not connecting to AP | Wrong WiFi credentials in DUT | Verify AP is running: `curl .../api/wifi/ap_status` |
| BLE scan finds nothing | Bluetooth powered off | `sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth && sudo hciconfig hci0 up && sudo bluetoothctl power on` |
| No UDP logs appearing | ESP32 not sending to correct IP/port | Verify firmware log host is `esp32-workbench.local:5555` |
| Firmware download returns 404 | Wrong path or not uploaded | Check `curl .../api/firmware/list` |
| GPIO pin has no effect | Wrong BCM pin number or not wired | Verify wiring; only BCM pins in the allowlist work |

## Claude Code Skills

The workbench comes with Claude Code skills that let an AI agent operate the workbench via curl. Each skill covers one domain and includes endpoints, curl examples, prerequisites, and troubleshooting.

### Installing Skills

Clone this repo into your workspace and symlink its skills into your project's `.claude/skills/` directory so Claude Code discovers them automatically:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SensorsIot/Universal-ESP32-Workbench
mkdir -p .claude
ln -s "$(pwd)/Universal-ESP32-Workbench/.claude/skills" .claude/skills
```

Restart Claude Code (or run `/clear`) for the skills to take effect.
